## ü§ñ AI Tools & Assistance

This project used AI tools to accelerate development:

- **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**
  Used for:
  - Initial scaffolding of project setup and boilerplate code.
  - Generating Axios service layer examples.
  - Drafting Vue component templates for filtering and card display.
  - Drafting this README file and refining instructions.

- **GitHub Copilot**
  Assisted in writing repetitive Vue boilerplate code and minor TypeScript typings.

All outputs were reviewed and adapted manually to match the requirements.
